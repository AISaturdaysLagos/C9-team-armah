The region of phase space is\\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\\nselection of events.\\n',\n",

Moreover, the linear term is\nsignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.\nTherefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller\nthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical\nsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number\nof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.\n"

The distribution function has a $\\delta$-like\nsingularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density\nhas a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent\nor vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations\nusing exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner\nordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger\nliquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it\noverestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal. An improvement of the\nLuttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above\nfeatures correctly. It is based on the corrected form of the density operator\nconserving the particle number.\n"

If the Casimir energy densities near one boundary result in a\ncertain constant of integration taking a value greater than around 10^5 in\nunits of the d = 11 gravitational length, a form of thick pipe geometry is\nfound that realizes TeV-scale gravity by the ADD mechanism, with that boundary\nbecoming the inner surface of the thick pipe, where we live. Three alternative\nways in which the outer surface of the thick pipe might be stabilized\nconsistent with the observed value of the effective d = 4 cosmological constant\nare considered. In the first alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in\nthe classical region and the constant of integration is fixed at around 10^{13}\nin units of the d = 11 gravitational length for consistency with the observed\ncosmological constant. In the second alternative, the four observed dimensions\nhave reduced in size down to the d = 11 gravitational length at the outer\nsurface, and there are Casimir effects near the outer surface. In the third\nalternative, the outer surface is stabilized in the classical region by extra\nfluxes of the three-form gauge field, whose four-form field strength wraps\nthree-cycles of the compact six-manifold times the radial dimension of the\nthick pipe.

There are now 30\nJupiter-family comets with known debris trails, of which 22 are reported in\nthis paper for the first time. The detection rate is >80%, indicating that\ndebris trails are a generic feature of short-period comets. By comparison to\norbital calculations for particles of a range of sizes ejected over 2 yr prior\nto observation, we find that particles comprising 4 debris trails are typically\nmm-sized while the remainder of the debris trails require particles larger than\nthis. The lower-limit masses of the debris trails are typically 10^11 g, and\nthe median mass loss rate is 2 kg/s.
