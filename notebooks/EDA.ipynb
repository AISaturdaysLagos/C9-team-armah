We prove that errors in any measured quantity are\nbounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when\nthe latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is\nsignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.\nTherefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller\nthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical\nsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number\nof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.\n"

The distribution function has a $\\delta$-like\nsingularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density\nhas a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent\nor vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations\nusing exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner\nordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger\nliquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it\noverestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal. An improvement of the\nLuttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above\nfeatures correctly. It is based on the corrected form of the density operator\nconserving the particle number.\n"

If the Casimir energy densities near one boundary result in a\ncertain constant of integration taking a value greater than around 10^5 in\nunits of the d = 11 gravitational length, a form of thick pipe geometry is\nfound that realizes TeV-scale gravity by the ADD mechanism, with that boundary\nbecoming the inner surface of the thick pipe, where we live. Three alternative\nways in which the outer surface of the thick pipe might be stabilized\nconsistent with the observed value of the effective d = 4 cosmological constant\nare considered. In the first alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in\nthe classical region and the constant of integration is fixed at around 10^{13}\nin units of the d = 11 gravitational length for consistency with the observed\ncosmological constant. In the second alternative, the four observed dimensions\nhave reduced in size down to the d = 11 gravitational length at the outer\nsurface, and there are Casimir effects near the outer surface. In the third\nalternative, the outer surface is stabilized in the classical region by extra\nfluxes of the three-form gauge field, whose four-form field strength wraps\nthree-cycles of the compact six-manifold times the radial dimension of the\nthick pipe. Some problems related to fitting the strong/electroweak Standard\nModel are considered.\n"

         "  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete\ndipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are\nbounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when\nthe latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is\nsignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.\nTherefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller\nthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical\nsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number\nof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.\n"
